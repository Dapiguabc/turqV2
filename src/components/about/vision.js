          Lawmakers are overwhelmed and donâ€™t have the time to make all the legislation that is needed of them. Our focus is to alleviate the pressure on legislators by enabling citizens to write bills for one another. We get that legislation made and submitted for you to make the ask of elected lawmakers as lightweight as possible.
