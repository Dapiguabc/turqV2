purpose: There is extensive debate regarding the efficacy of financial literacy
  education and the correlation between applied knowledge of personal finance
  best known methods and overall good financial health/satisfaction. There has
  been very little data collection with enough participants over a long enough
  time to make effective causal correlation between financial literacy education
  and long term financial behavior (Robb).

  curriculum for financial literacy educational inclusion. It provides data
  collection and standardized testing outlines for evaluation of financial
  literacy education effectiveness.
 

  This legislation commissions the creation of
  an opt-in voluntary study in which students graduating the Massachusetts
  Public or Charter School System allow the ongoing, long-term collection of
  income, credit worthiness, and other financial health and satisfaction metrics
  as defined by the study authors.
