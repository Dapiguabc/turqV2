purpose: >-
  With the world reaching the peak of this pandemic caused by COVID-19, and the
  big question that all golfers are asking, how is our daily golf? The concept
  of Quality of Life is not unanimously defined, being often ambiguous and
  elusive, however factors such as education, health, environment, politics,
  economy, living conditions, society and productivity can be part of this
  concept. This narrative review, observes golf as a recreational or sport
  activity, which produces beneficial effects on several of these factors since
  it promotes low intensity physical exercise, appropriate even for cardiac
  patients. The improvements in balance, strength, physiological and mental
  parameters are noticeable, especially in the population. It can be practiced
  simultaneously by children, adults and the elderly, through the Handicap
  System, something that few sports can do, serving as a stimulus for social
  activities of a population. Golf is therefore a lifelong activity, which
  improves Quality

  of Life of all its practitioners, also serving as a tool for social inclusion.
provisions: >-
  (1) Biological control uses natural enemies of pests and diseases on plants
  and soils to reduce their impact, which means using three times fewer

  revolve around this key alternative to ensure the sustainability of the
